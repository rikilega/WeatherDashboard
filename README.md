## What Is This?:

This project is a Javascript WEATHER DASHBOARD to show case my work as a programmer, and help improve my programming skills. My page should meet the following requirements:

## Relevant Information:

This app does the following:

It fetches data from weather API upon the submission of a city input by the user (into the search bar).

When the user enters a city into the search bar, and the app will return the weather forecast for the current day as well as small tiles with information aabout the next 5-day forecast.

Searches are saved in local storage and after the user has submitted at least 2 searches the top searches will be stored in a separate array in local storage and buttons will appear on screen, the next time the user reloads the page, which will allow the user to quickly load these top searches from local storage.
